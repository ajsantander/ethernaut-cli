# ethernaut-cli

Ethereum swiss army ~knife~ ~superweapon~ ~cli~ ~tool~ thing?
for Ethereum hackers.

## Installation

`npm i -g ethernaut-cli`

## Intuitive navigation

No more man pages. No more --help.

Just type `ethernaut` and jump into an enquirer based intuitive navigation mode. Select a scope, select a task, and boom.

## Smart interactive mode

Once in a task, interactive mode kicks in, and all parameters are collected through enquirer prompts.

## Ui extensions

Plugins of plugins that enhance param collection prompts with cooler prompts, smart suggestions, etc.

## Natural language to cli commands

If that wasn't easy enough, just type whatever you want and AI will kick in to try to make sense of what you typed, and the right command or sequence of commands will be executed.

You want the AI to also teach you how the commands work? Sure.

You want the AI to also teach you about Ethereum. Also sure.
