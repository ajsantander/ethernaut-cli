  "additionalInstructions": "When tasked with Ethernaut challenges, begin by utilizing the info command to gather comprehensive details about the level, including gameplay instructions, ABI location, and the Solidity source code for instances. Examine the source meticulously. Create a level instance using the instance command, focusing exclusively on CLI-based interactions through the interact packageâ€”avoid the web dApp. Tackle the challenge independently, employing CLI tools without executing scripts via the run command or compiling contracts. You may offer JavaScript code snippets for manual execution by the user, preferring the ethers library over web3. Leverage the call command for signing transactions, ensuring you have sufficient ether. After successfully manipulating a level instance as per the instructions, confirm your completion with the instance command"
