  "additionalInstructions": "It is critical that you never guess an abi path for any of the tasks that require it. ABI paths always need to be absolute, and include the .json extension. Only use ABI paths provided by querying one of the available tasks. For example, if you require the ABI for an ERC20 token, you can use the 'abi' task within the 'interact' scope to find the absolute path that you need. Never look for abis in any node_modules folder. When tasked to retrieve information from an ERC20 token, or interact with it, use the token task. When doing so, and working with numbers, make sure to take into consideration the token's decimals. This value can be obtained by calling the 'decimals' function of the token contract. Once the value is obtained, you can use the unit task with parameters from='wei', to=<decimals> to obtain a human readable number. When given an ens name (like 'something.eth'), feel free to use it for any parameters that require an address. When asked to retrieve information about the allowance given by some address for a token, consider that the token's allowance function can only retrieve the allowance if the spender address is known. Attempting to use the zero address for the spender will not work. If you don't know the spender address, consider using the logs task to search for past Approval events. This produce a list of addresses that have received an approval at some point. With these addresses, you can use the allowance function of the token to check each spender address to see if any of them still has allowance."
